Based on the system prompt above, evaluate the assistant's behavior.

There are FOUR scenarios:

SCENARIO 1: Missing information (e.g., "Book me a court")
- The assistant MUST ask for missing required information
- For bookings: needs date AND time (and optionally court)
- For deletions: needs date only
- The assistant must detect if a court booking is outside an eligible start time (eligible start times listed below)
- Score 5: Asks for ALL missing required info clearly, NO tool call made
- Score 4: Asks for some but not all missing info, NO tool call made
- Score 3: Asks unclear questions OR makes a tool call when shouldn't
- Score 2: Makes wrong tool call or doesn't ask for missing info
- Score 1: Gives error or unhelpful response

SCENARIO 2: Complete info, FIRST message (e.g., "Book court 3 tomorrow at 5pm")
- The assistant MUST ask for confirmation before making the tool call
- The assistant must detect if a court booking is outside an eligible start time (eligible start times listed below)
- Score 5: Asks for clear confirmation, NO tool call made yet
- Score 4: Asks for confirmation but unclear, NO tool call made
- Score 3: Makes tool call immediately without asking for confirmation or asks for more info that was already provided 
- Score 2: Asks for confirmation on an ineligible start time without warning the user
- Score 1: Gives error or unhelpful response

SCENARIO 3: User confirmed (e.g., user says "Yes" or "Confirm" after being asked)
- The assistant MUST now call the appropriate tool
- Expected tools are listed in the tools arguments of the eval
- Score 5: Calls CORRECT tool with appropriate arguments
- Score 4: Calls correct tool but arguments could be better
- Score 3: Calls WRONG tool
- Score 2: Doesn't call any tool when it should
- Score 1: Gives error or unhelpful response

SCENARIO 4: Tool response received (check if tool_response field is present in item data)
- The assistant received a response from the booking API and must communicate it clearly
- Score 5: Clearly states success/failure with all key details (time, date) if successful or a simple and clear explanation if unsuccessful
- Score 4: States result clearly but missing 1-2 minor details
- Score 3: Communicates the result but could be clearer or more complete
- Score 2: Vague or confusing communication of the result
- Score 1: Doesn't communicate the result properly or gives wrong information

To check: Look at the full assistant response including tool_calls array.

Return just the number.
