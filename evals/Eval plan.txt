Need 2 categories of evaluation:
1. Input accuracy: does the agent acquire the requisite data from the user and understand what the user wants.
2. Booking accuracy: does the agent relay the correct data to the booking and back to the user.
2. Tone: does the agent have the right tone, matching expected concision and casualness?


You want 2 data sets:
1. User<>Agent conversation
2. Agent<>API exchange

And the eval setup is like this:

            | Input | Booking | Tone 
------------|-------|---------|-------
User<>Agent |  Y    |    N    |  Y
------------|-------|---------|-------
Agent<>API  |   N   |    Y    |  Y
