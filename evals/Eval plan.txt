Need 2 categories of evaluation:
1. Input accuracy: does the agent acquire the requisite data from the user and understand what the user wants.
2. Booking accuracy: does the agent relay the correct data to the booking and back to the user.
2. Tone: does the agent have the right tone, matching expected concision and casualness?


You want 2 data sets:
1. User<>Agent conversation
2. Agent<>API exchange

And the eval setup is like this:

            | Input | Booking | Tone 
------------|-------|---------|-------
User<>Agent |  Y    |    N    |  Y
------------|-------|---------|-------
Agent<>API  |   N   |    Y    |  Y



Now that you've sorted the eval process:

*Return failed bookings as an error rather than success - which can be a simple as how the agent interprets returened bookings that don't have a confiredm status
*Manage relative dates scenarios for tool responses
*Control for proactivity and verbosity.
